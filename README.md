# Advent of Code 2023

Working through the Advent of Code 2023 challenges to improve my Rust skills. All of the solutions are for "part 2" of the challenges.

To run the solutions, you will need to copy the input files from the [Advent of Code 2023 website](https://adventofcode.com/2023/input) into a root-level directory called `inputs`. The input files are named `input1.txt`, `input2.txt`, etc.

## Usage

To run a specific day, run the following command:
```bash
cargo run <day_number>
```

For example, to run day 1, run the following command:
```bash
cargo run 1
```
